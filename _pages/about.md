I'm a Data Scientist at Microsoft India working on problems in NLP and Data Science. Our team powers the Bing's People Also Ask experience which involves showing related question and answers for a given query solving intents in query exploration and reformulation. I am working on multilingual techniques for enabling PAA in non-English markets. 

I am passionate about the applications of AI and Deep Learning to the field of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition. 

I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore in 2017. 

I did a 3 month research intern in Canada and have been to Japan as a student delegate and would love to travel and explore the world. I play drums and keyboard. I have also played tabla and badminton professionally.
