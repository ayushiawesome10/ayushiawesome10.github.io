I'm a Data Scientist at Microsoft India working on problems in NLP and Data Science. Our team powers the Bing's People Also Ask experience which involves showing related question and answers at scale for a given user query helping users in tasks such as query exploration and reformulation. I work on data science and deep learning techniques to improve the coverage and relevance of our experience and also work on universalizing our stack across multiple markets and languages.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I did my internships at Microsoft Research Labs India and The University of Calgary as an undergraduate student from PES Institute of Technology where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering in 2017. I am passionate about the applications of AI and Deep Learning in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and I am always on the lookout for interesting problems and challanges. 

I love to travel and would like to explore the world one day. I play drums and keyboard and have played tabla and badminton professionally.
