I'm a Sophomore currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at PES UNIVERSITY, Bangalore. I am passionate about the applications of AI and Deep Learning in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and I am always in the quest of working on challenging algorithms. 

I also enjoy getting myself imaginative with diverse art and craft and my other hobbies include singing song, playing badminton and keyboard among many others.
