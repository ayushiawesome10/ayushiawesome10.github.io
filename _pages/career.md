## My goal is to **shape the scientific vision** of a company which uses **computational biology or data science to impact society**.

More specifically, I envision my eventual ideal **role** as a CSO, or CSO-like person. I want to:

- interact with data analysis in a non-trivial way, either through doing analyses myself or advising on computational/data analysis work
- engage non-scientists and get them excited about our work and potential impact
- shape the long-term vision of the company I am a part of

## **Jobs that would excite me:**
-creating computerised robots that could imitate the working of a human being.
